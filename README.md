This is a python django project

Flood Relief Camp organization is a website which shifts out traditional ways
of manual recordings of flood victims details into digital. Our project's aim is
to communicate with the people and their loved ones inside and outside of
the camp. The camp organizer can enter all the details of the camp. The
people outside the camp can easily find information about people who are in
the camp.
The camp organizer can update all victimsâ€™ addresses and their needs by
using this site. The admin controls the system. Admin can add users, camp
organizers, health coordinators, volunteers, police and collectors. The users
can view only a part of the details regarding the victims. The collector, police
and camp organizers will have access to all the details regarding the victims
and camp.
